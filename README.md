# üß† AgentNull: AI Agent Threat Catalog + Proof-of-Concepts

This repository contains a red team-oriented catalog of attack vectors targeting autonomous AI agents (e.g., MCP, LangGraph, AutoGPT) along with individual proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for each.

## üìò Structure

- `catalog/AgentNull_Catalog.md` ‚Äî Human-readable threat catalog
- `catalog/AgentNull_Catalog.json` ‚Äî Structured version for SOC/SIEM ingestion
- `pocs/` ‚Äî One directory per attack vector, each with its own README, code, and sample input/output

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository is for **educational and internal security research** purposes only. Do not deploy any techniques or code herein in production or against systems you do not own or have explicit authorization to test.

## üîß Usage

Navigate into each `pocs/<attack_name>/` folder and follow the README to replicate the attack scenario.

## üß© Attack Vectors Covered

### High Priority (New)
- **Full-Schema Poisoning (FSP)** - Exploit any field in tool schema beyond descriptions
- **Advanced Tool Poisoning Attack (ATPA)** - Manipulate tool outputs to trigger secondary actions
- **MCP Rug Pull Attack** - Swap benign descriptions for malicious ones after approval

### Medium Priority (New)
- **Schema Validation Bypass** - Exploit client validation implementation differences

### Existing Vectors
- Recursive memory leaks
- Tool confusion attacks
- Subprompt extraction
- Planning backdoors
- Infinite token/task generation
- Heuristic drift injection
- Hidden file exploitation
- Nested function hijacking
- Semantic DoS attacks
- Token gaslighting

...and more.
